# rsa-gen
Generates an RSA key pair and asks you to crack it. Made to create practice questions for CM12006.

# How to use
Install rust if you don't already have it.
Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/peterc-s/rsa-gen`.
`cd` into the cloned repository.
`cargo run --release`

# Notes
You can modify the program to encrypt strings instead. It has not been made very robust as it's just a quick script so don't expect it to handle erroneous inputs. Improve it if you want.
